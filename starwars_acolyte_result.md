##The Acolyte (TV series)

***The Acolyte***, also known as ***Star Wars: The Acolyte***,[^1][^2]
is an upcoming American [science
fiction](Science_fiction_on_television "wikilink") television series
created by [Leslye Headland](Leslye_Headland "wikilink") for the
streaming service [Disney+](Disney+ "wikilink"). It is part of the
*[Star Wars](Star_Wars "wikilink")* franchise, set at the end of the
[High Republic](Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic "wikilink") era before the
events of the [main *Star Wars* films](Skywalker_Saga "wikilink"), and
follows a [Jedi](Jedi "wikilink") investigation into a series of crimes.

[Amandla Stenberg](Amandla_Stenberg "wikilink"), [Lee
Jung-jae](Lee_Jung-jae "wikilink"), [Manny
Jacinto](Manny_Jacinto "wikilink"), [Dafne Keen](Dafne_Keen "wikilink"),
[Charlie Barnett](Charlie_Barnett_(actor) "wikilink"), [Jodie
Turner-Smith](Jodie_Turner-Smith "wikilink"), [Rebecca
Henderson](Rebecca_Henderson_(actress) "wikilink"), [Dean-Charles
Chapman](Dean-Charles_Chapman "wikilink"), [Joonas
Suotamo](Joonas_Suotamo "wikilink"), and [Carrie-Anne
Moss](Carrie-Anne_Moss "wikilink") star in the series. Headland
expressed interest in working on the *Star Wars* franchise by the end of
2019, and was developing a new series for
[Lucasfilm](Lucasfilm "wikilink") by April 2020. The title was announced
that December. Filming took place in London and at Shinfield Studios in
[Berkshire](Berkshire "wikilink") from October 2022 to June 2023, with
location filming in Wales and Portugal.

*The Acolyte* is scheduled to premiere on Disney+ on June 4, 2024, with
its first two episodes. The other six episodes will be released weekly.

## Premise

*The Acolyte* is set at the end of the *[Star
Wars](Star_Wars "wikilink")* franchise's [High
Republic](Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic "wikilink") era, approximately
100 years before *[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom
Menace](Star_Wars:_Episode_I_–_The_Phantom_Menace "wikilink")*
(1999).[^3][^4] It sees a respected [Jedi](Jedi "wikilink") Master
investigating a series of crimes that bring him into conflict with a
former [Padawan](Padawan_(Star_Wars) "wikilink") learner and reveal
sinister forces.[^5][^6]

## Cast

-   [Amandla Stenberg](Amandla_Stenberg "wikilink") as Mae: A former
    [Padawan](Padawan_(Star_Wars) "wikilink") learner who is now a
    dangerous warrior[^7]
-   [Lee Jung-jae](Lee_Jung-jae "wikilink") as Sol: A respected
    [Jedi](Jedi "wikilink") Master.[^8] Lee learned
    [English](English_language "wikilink") for the role.[^9]
-   [Manny Jacinto](Manny_Jacinto "wikilink") as Qimir: A former
    smuggler who now lives a life of leisure[^10]
-   [Dafne Keen](Dafne_Keen "wikilink") as Jecki Lon: Sol's young
    Padawan[^11]
-   [Charlie Barnett](Charlie_Barnett_(actor) "wikilink") as Yord
    Fandar: A by-the-book Jedi Knight and temple guardian[^12]

    [Leslye Headland](Leslye_Headland "wikilink") wanted the audience to
    immediately feel that Indara was "the most powerful Jedi in the
    room". She was inspired by Moss's portrayal of
    [Trinity](Trinity_(The_Matrix) "wikilink") in [*The Matrix* film
    series](The_Matrix_(franchise) "wikilink") when creating the
    character and intended for audiences to see Indara as "Trinity with
    a [lightsaber](lightsaber "wikilink")".[^19]

Additionally, [Margarita Levieva](Margarita_Levieva "wikilink"), Amy
Tsang, and [David Harewood](David_Harewood "wikilink") have been cast in
undisclosed roles,[^20][^21][^22] and [Abigail
Thorn](Abigail_Thorn "wikilink") will appear as Ensign Eurus.[^23]

## Episodes

## Production

### Development

At the premiere of the film *[Star Wars: The Rise of
Skywalker](Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker "wikilink")* (2019),
television writer [Leslye Headland](Leslye_Headland "wikilink") was
asked about her interest in the *[Star Wars](Star_Wars "wikilink")*
franchise and revealed that she was a big fan with many ideas for *Star
Wars* films that she wanted to make if she was asked to by
[Lucasfilm](Lucasfilm "wikilink") president [Kathleen
Kennedy](Kathleen_Kennedy_(producer) "wikilink").[^24] Headland
contacted Lucasfilm to discuss her ideas after completing work on her
series *[Russian Doll](Russian_Doll_(TV_series) "wikilink")*
(2019–2022), and [pitched](Pitch_(filmmaking) "wikilink") a new *Star
Wars* series with a first-season outline and full [series
bible](Bible_(screenwriting) "wikilink"). Kennedy agreed to begin work
on the series during that initial pitch meeting,[^25] and Headland was
revealed in April 2020 to be writing and
[showrunning](showrunning "wikilink") a new female-centric *Star Wars*
series for the streaming service [Disney+](Disney+ "wikilink"). Staffing
for the series had begun and it was expected to be set in a different
part of the franchise's timeline from other *Star Wars* projects.[^26]

Lucasfilm confirmed Headland's series was in development on May 4, 2020,
which is *Star Wars* Day.[^27] At [Disney](Disney "wikilink")'s Investor
Day event on December 10, Kennedy announced the title, *The Acolyte*,
and said it was set at the end of the [High
Republic](Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic "wikilink") era before the events
of the [main *Star Wars* films](Skywalker_Saga "wikilink").[^28]
Lucasfilm executive Rayne Roberts was developing the series with
Headland,[^29] who was influenced by the games and novels of the [*Star
Wars* Expanded Universe](Star_Wars_in_other_media "wikilink") (EU).[^30]
The first season consists of eight episodes,[^31] with Headland
directing the first two.[^32] Alex Garcia Lopez and
[Kogonada](Kogonada "wikilink") were hired to direct episodes by
February 2023,[^33] and [Hanelle
Culpepper](Hanelle_Culpepper "wikilink") was revealed to have directed
episodes in March 2024. Executive producers include Headland, Kennedy,
Simon Emanuel, [Jeff F. King](Jeff_F._King "wikilink"), and Jason
Micallef, with Roberts, Damian Anderson, Eileen Shim, and Rob Bredow
producing.[^34]

In March 2024, Headland said she had pitched multiple seasons of the
series to Lucasfilm and had a plan for a second season if it was
ordered. She did note that she wanted to take a break after the first
season was released due to the long production timeline for the first
season, and so she could respond to any feedback from fans on the first
season when developing the second.[^35]

### Writing

A [writers' room](writers'_room "wikilink") for the series was assembled
by June 2021. Headland made sure the group included writers with
different relationships to *Star Wars*, including some who were only
fans of the [original trilogy](original_trilogy "wikilink"), some who
were specifically fans of [Dave Filoni](Dave_Filoni "wikilink")'s *Star
Wars* projects, and one writer who had never seen *Star Wars*
before.[^36][^37] The series' writers included Jason Micallef, Charmaine
DeGrate, Jasmyne Flournoy, Eileen Shim, Claire Kiechel, Kor Adana,
Cameron Squires, [Jocelyn Bioh](Jocelyn_Bioh "wikilink"), and Jen
Richards.[^38] When pitching the series to Lucasfilm, Headland described
it as "*[Frozen](Frozen_(2013_film) "wikilink")* meets *[Kill
Bill](Kill_Bill "wikilink")*".[^39][^40] Responding to discussion of the
series being "female-centric", Headland said it would have a female
protagonist but would not exclude male characters or audiences. She
added that the series introduces new characters and ideas to the
franchise that she hoped would interest existing fans, but she
understood that not all fans would like it and felt that was fine
considering there were so many new *Star Wars* projects being
produced.[^41] In May 2022, Headland said writing for the series was
mostly complete.[^42]

Headland wanted to explore the *Star Wars* franchise from the
perspective of the villains. She felt the High Republic era would be the
best point in the timeline to do this because the
[Sith](Sith "wikilink"), who are the villains in the films, are
considerably outnumbered and in hiding during this time.[^43] Lucasfilm
also wanted to depict the time period on screen after recently launching
a publishing initiative set in the era, and because they wanted to
explore new parts of the *Star Wars* timeline away from the films and
other series.[^44] Headland noted that *The Acolyte* was the earliest
point in the *Star Wars* timeline to be seen in live-action at that
point.[^45] She wanted to address some fan criticisms of the *Star Wars*
films, such as how [Darth Sidious](Darth_Sidious "wikilink") ascends to
power without the [Jedi](Jedi "wikilink") knowing: "How did we get to a
point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi
pick up on it? \[What\] went wrong?" She considered herself lucky to be
able to ask those questions in an actual *Star Wars* project.[^46][^47]
A key theme in the franchise for Headland was "underdog versus
institutional threat", and in this part of the timeline it is the Jedi
who are the main institution.[^48] In contrast to the Jedi in the films,
who are monk-like figures in times of war, Headland said the High
Republic Jedi live in a time of peace and enlightenment akin to the
[Renaissance](Renaissance "wikilink"), as seen in their white and gold
robes that look like they never get dirty.[^49] The series questions the
Jedi practice of training children,[^50] and also explores differing
views on [the Force](the_Force "wikilink") and the amount of power and
control that the Jedi have.[^51] Headland took inspiration from the film
*[Rashomon](Rashomon "wikilink")* (1950) to depict events from multiple
perspectives, showing how the series' protagonist, former
[Padawan](Padawan_(Star_Wars) "wikilink") learner Mae, sees things
differently to the Jedi Order.[^52]

*The Acolyte* is a [mystery thriller](Mystery_fiction "wikilink") with a
serialized story that builds throughout the first season, inspired by
the approach of fellow *Star Wars* series
*[Andor](Andor_(TV_series) "wikilink")*.[^53] Because there are no
overarching conflicts or wars in the series—Headland said it was
"interesting to make a *Star Wars* with no war in it"—the fight
sequences are more intimate,[^54] focusing on duels that further develop
the characters.[^55] Noting that *Star Wars* creator [George
Lucas](George_Lucas "wikilink") was originally influenced by
[Westerns](Western_(genre) "wikilink") and [Akira
Kurosawa](Akira_Kurosawa "wikilink")'s samurai films, Headland decided
to take more influence from [martial arts](martial_arts "wikilink")
films which she felt were "a little bit more personal and less global
and galactic". These included [wuxia](wuxia "wikilink") films by [King
Hu](King_Hu "wikilink") and [Shaw Brothers
Studio](Shaw_Brothers_Studio "wikilink") such as *[Come Drink with
Me](Come_Drink_with_Me "wikilink")* (1966) and *[A Touch of
Zen](A_Touch_of_Zen "wikilink")* (1971).[^56] Similar to the *Star Wars*
series *[The Mandalorian](The_Mandalorian "wikilink")*,[^57] *The
Acolyte* includes [Easter eggs](Easter_egg_(media) "wikilink") for fans
of the original trilogy, [prequel trilogy](prequel_trilogy "wikilink"),
and the animated series *[Star Wars: The Clone
Wars](Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_(2008_TV_series) "wikilink")*, as well
as references to the EU and [*Star Wars*
Legends](Star_Wars_Legends "wikilink"). EU references include members of
the Theelin and Zygerrian species as well as some narrative
elements.[^58] The series introduces a coven of Force witches, separate
from the [Nightsister](Nightsister "wikilink") witches seen in previous
*Star Wars* projects, inspired by mentions of Force cults in the High
Republic books and the EU.[^59]

### Casting

Casting was underway by the end of June 2021, when Lucasfilm were
looking to hire a young woman of color for the lead role.[^60] [Amandla
Stenberg](Amandla_Stenberg "wikilink") was in talks for that part in
December,[^61] and was confirmed to be cast in July 2022.[^62] [Jodie
Turner-Smith](Jodie_Turner-Smith "wikilink") and *Russian Doll* co-star
[Charlie Barnett](Charlie_Barnett_(actor) "wikilink") entered final
negotiations to join the series in September 2022,[^63][^64] when [Lee
Jung-jae](Lee_Jung-jae "wikilink") and [Manny
Jacinto](Manny_Jacinto "wikilink") were cast. Lee was cast as the male
lead,[^65][^66] after Headland was impressed with his performance in the
television series *[Squid Game](Squid_Game "wikilink")*.[^67] At the
start of November, [Dafne Keen](Dafne_Keen "wikilink") was revealed to
have a role in the series.[^68] Soon after, Lucasfilm confirmed the
casting of Stenberg, Lee, Jacinto, Turner-Smith, Barnett, and Keen, and
announced the casting of [Dean-Charles
Chapman](Dean-Charles_Chapman "wikilink"), [Carrie-Anne
Moss](Carrie-Anne_Moss "wikilink"), and Headland's wife [Rebecca
Henderson](Rebecca_Henderson_(actress) "wikilink").[^69][^70] Headland
had Stenberg, Barnett, and Keen in mind when creating their
characters;[^71][^72] she wanted to see Keen with a
[lightsaber](lightsaber "wikilink") after her performance as the
character [X-23](X-23 "wikilink") in *[Logan](Logan_(film) "wikilink")*
(2017).[^73] [Margarita Levieva](Margarita_Levieva "wikilink") was cast
in a guest role by the start of December.[^74]

At [*Star Wars* Celebration
London](Star_Wars_Celebration#Celebration_Europe_2023 "wikilink") in
April 2023, [Joonas Suotamo](Joonas_Suotamo "wikilink") was revealed to
be part of the series' cast as [Wookiee](Wookiee "wikilink") Jedi
Kelnacca. Suotamo previously portrayed the Wookiee
[Chewbacca](Chewbacca "wikilink") in the [sequel
trilogy](sequel_trilogy "wikilink") films and *[Solo: A Star Wars
Story](Solo:_A_Star_Wars_Story "wikilink")* (2018).[^75] Also at the
convention, Lee, Keen, Barnett, Henderson, and Moss were revealed to be
playing Jedi,[^76] with Henderson cast as the character Vernestra Rwoh
who was introduced in the High Republic publishing initiative.[^77] In
March 2024, Headland said Rwoh was the only character from the High
Republic books that would appear in the first season, but there were
other High Republic characters that she hoped to include in a potential
second season. She felt Rwoh was important for showing the state of the
Jedi Order in the series, contrasting her role as a leader in the order
with the young prodigy she is depicted as in the books.[^78] Also that
month, character details for most of the series' main cast were
revealed, with Stenberg as former Padawan Mae, Lee as Jedi Master Sol,
Jacinto as former smuggler Qimir, Keen as Padawan Jecki Lon, Barnett as
Jedi Knight Yord Fandar, Turner-Smith as coven-leader Mother Aniseya,
and Moss as Jedi Master Indara.[^79] Headland said it was a "no-brainer"
to cast Moss as Indara, who was inspired by Moss's portrayal of
[Trinity](Trinity_(The_Matrix) "wikilink") in [*The Matrix* film
series](The_Matrix_(franchise) "wikilink").[^80] In April, [David
Harewood](David_Harewood "wikilink") was reported to have a small role
in the series.[^81]

### Design

Headland noted that the original trilogy has a lived-in quality while
the prequel trilogy is sleeker and more advanced. With *The Acolyte*,
she carried on this concept of "the further you go back, the more
exciting and new and sleek and interesting things look".[^82] It was
important for her to replicate the white and gold Jedi robes from the
High Republic books to symbolize the state of the Order, compared to the
brown robes later worn in the films.[^83]

### Filming

[Principal photography](Principal_photography "wikilink") began by
October 30, 2022, at Shinfield Studios in
[Berkshire](Berkshire "wikilink"),[^84][^85] under the [working
title](working_title "wikilink") *Paradox*.[^86] Headland, Kogonada,
Lopez, and Culpepper directed two episodes each.[^87] [James
Friend](James_Friend "wikilink") and Chris Teague served as
cinematographers.[^88][^89] The series was initially reported to be
using visual effects company [Industrial Light &
Magic](Industrial_Light_&_Magic "wikilink")'s
[StageCraft](StageCraft "wikilink") technology to shoot in front of
digital backgrounds on a [video wall](video_wall "wikilink"), as was
done for *The Mandalorian* and its spin-off series,[^90] but Headland
later said the series was primarily filmed on practical sets and did not
use the technology,[^91] for creative and logistical reasons.[^92]

Location filming had begun in Wales by January 2023,[^93] including at
[Brecon Beacons National
Park](Brecon_Beacons_National_Park "wikilink").[^94] From mid to late
March, filming took place on [Madeira
Island](Madeira_Island "wikilink"), Portugal,[^95][^96][^97] including
at Fanal Forest and the parishes of [Caniçal](Caniçal "wikilink") and
[Ribeira da Janela](Ribeira_da_Janela "wikilink").[^98] In early April,
there were said to be only a few weeks of production remaining.[^99]
Filming officially [wrapped](wrap_(filmmaking) "wikilink") on June
6.[^100] Headland said filming went smoothly despite the length of
production and the amount of action sequences and
[wire-work](wire-work "wikilink"). She said the cast did most of their
own action scenes, including actors who had worked in action before such
as Lee, Keen, and Moss. Stenberg, who was new to action, "threw herself
into training and did incredible work in a short amount of time".[^101]

### Post-production

Miikka Leskinen was one of the series' editors.[^102] Headland said
[ADR](Automated_dialogue_replacement "wikilink") work could not be
completed during the [2023 SAG-AFTRA
strike](2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike "wikilink") which delayed the end of
post-production, but the series was mostly done by March 2024.[^103]

## Music

[Michael Abels](Michael_Abels "wikilink") was hired to compose the score
for the series by February 2024.[^104]

## Marketing

Headland and members of the cast presented the first footage from the
series at *Star Wars* Celebration London in April 2023.[^105] The first
trailer was publicly released in March 2024, and teases that Jedi are
being killed. Charles Pulliam-Moore of *[The
Verge](The_Verge "wikilink")* speculated that Stenberg's character could
be the murderer and highlighted the darker aspects of the trailer,
including the suggestion that many characters could die in the
series.[^106] *[IGN](IGN "wikilink")*{{'s}} Ryan Dinsdale noted the
elements in the trailer that are associated with the High Republic,
including the white robes and yellow lightsabers of some Jedi
characters, and compared some scenes to the aesthetics of the original
and prequel trilogies.[^107] Writing for
*[Empire](Empire_(magazine) "wikilink")*, Ben Travis discussed how the
series had been kept a mystery for so long but was finally starting to
publicly reveal details with this trailer. He opined that while *Andor*
focuses on human drama, the trailer indicates that *The Acolyte* will be
going "all-out on colourful species, lightsabers, and Force-users", and
he praised the small amount of action that the trailer shows.[^108]
Lucasfilm announced that the trailer was watched 51.3 million times in
its first 24 hours, setting a record for the company's streaming series
by surpassing the trailers for *The Mandalorian*, *[The Book of Boba
Fett](The_Book_of_Boba_Fett "wikilink")*, *Andor*, *[Obi-Wan
Kenobi](Obi-Wan_Kenobi_(TV_series) "wikilink")*, and
*[Ahsoka](Ahsoka_(TV_series) "wikilink")*.[^109] An exclusive preview of
the series will be included at the end of 25th anniversary theatrical
screenings of *[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom
Menace](Star_Wars:_Episode_I_–_The_Phantom_Menace "wikilink")* (1999),
starting on May 3 in time for *Star Wars* Day on May 4.[^110]

## Release

*The Acolyte* is scheduled to premiere on Disney+ on June 4, 2024, with
its first two episodes. The other six episodes will be released
weekly.[^1]

## Lawsuit

In March 2023, Karyn McCarthy sued Lucasfilm over breach of contract,
stating that she was offered a producer role on both *The Acolyte* and
the [Apple TV+](Apple_TV+ "wikilink") series
*[Sugar](Sugar_(2024_TV_series) "wikilink")* and chose *The Acolyte*.
After several weeks of work in April 2022 based on an initial agreement
with Lucasfilm, McCarthy alleged that the studio chose to end her deal
and not pay her for her work so far. By that time, the *Sugar* role was
unavailable.[^2]
