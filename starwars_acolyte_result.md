== Production ==
=== Development ===
At the premiere of the film ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019), television writer [[Leslye Headland]] was asked about her interest in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise and revealed that she was a big fan with many ideas for ''Star Wars'' films that she wanted to make if she was asked to by [[Lucasfilm]] president [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]].<ref name="HeadlandEp9Premiere" /> Headland contacted Lucasfilm to discuss her ideas after completing work on her series ''[[Russian Doll (TV series)|Russian Doll]]'' (2019–2022), and [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] a new ''Star Wars'' series with a first-season outline and full [[Bible (screenwriting)|series bible]]. Kennedy agreed to begin work on the series during that initial pitch meeting,<ref name="HeadlandMar2024THR" /> and Headland was revealed in April 2020 to be writing and [[showrunning]] a new female-centric ''Star Wars'' series for the streaming service [[Disney+]]. Staffing for the series had begun and it was expected to be set in a different part of the franchise's timeline from other ''Star Wars'' projects.<ref name="VarietyApr2020" />

Lucasfilm confirmed Headland's series was in development on May 4, 2020, which is ''Star Wars'' Day.<ref name="HeadlandConfirmed" /> At [[Disney]]'s Investor Day event on December 10, Kennedy announced the title, ''The Acolyte'', and said it was set at the end of the [[Star Wars: The High Republic|High Republic]] era before the events of the [[Skywalker Saga|main ''Star Wars'' films]].<ref name="LucasfilmProjects" /> Lucasfilm executive Rayne Roberts was developing the series with Headland,<ref name="Roberts" /> who was influenced by the games and novels of the [[Star Wars in other media|''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe]] (EU).<ref name="VanityFairMay2022Acolyte" /> The first season consists of eight episodes,<ref name="FilmingLocation" /> with Headland directing the first two.<ref name="Mar2024DetailsSW" /> Alex Garcia Lopez and [[Kogonada]] were hired to direct episodes by February 2023,<ref name="KogonadaGarcia" /> and [[Hanelle Culpepper]] was revealed to have directed episodes in March 2024. Executive producers include Headland, Kennedy, Simon Emanuel, [[Jeff F. King]], and Jason Micallef, with Roberts, Damian Anderson, Eileen Shim, and Rob Bredow producing.<ref name="Mar2024DetailsSW" />

In March 2024, Headland said she had pitched multiple seasons of the series to Lucasfilm and had a plan for a second season if it was ordered. She did note that she wanted to take a break after the first season was released due to the long production timeline for the first season, and so she could respond to any feedback from fans on the first season when developing the second.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024Collider" />

=== Writing ===
A [[writers' room]] for the series was assembled by June 2021. Headland made sure the group included writers with different relationships to ''Star Wars'', including some who were only fans of the [[original trilogy]], some who were specifically fans of [[Dave Filoni]]'s ''Star Wars'' projects, and one writer who had never seen ''Star Wars'' before.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024THR" /><ref name="HeadlandWriters" /> The series' writers included Jason Micallef, Charmaine DeGrate, Jasmyne Flournoy, Eileen Shim, Claire Kiechel, Kor Adana, Cameron Squires, [[Jocelyn Bioh]], and Jen Richards.<ref name="WGACredits" /> When pitching the series to Lucasfilm, Headland described it as "''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' meets ''[[Kill Bill]]''".<ref name="HeadlandMar2024THR" /><ref name="CelebrationLondonEW" /> Responding to discussion of the series being "female-centric", Headland said it would have a female protagonist but would not exclude male characters or audiences. She added that the series introduces new characters and ideas to the franchise that she hoped would interest existing fans, but she understood that not all fans would like it and felt that was fine considering there were so many new ''Star Wars'' projects being produced.<ref name="HeadlandNov2020" /> In May 2022, Headland said writing for the series was mostly complete.<ref name="VanityFairMay2022" />

Headland wanted to explore the ''Star Wars'' franchise from the perspective of the villains. She felt the High Republic era would be the best point in the timeline to do this because the [[Sith]], who are the villains in the films, are considerably outnumbered and in hiding during this time.<ref name="VanityFairMay2022Acolyte" /> Lucasfilm also wanted to depict the time period on screen after recently launching a publishing initiative set in the era, and because they wanted to explore new parts of the ''Star Wars'' timeline away from the films and other series.<ref name="VanityFairMay2022Acolyte" /> Headland noted that ''The Acolyte'' was the earliest point in the ''Star Wars'' timeline to be seen in live-action at that point.<ref name="EWPeace" /> She wanted to address some fan criticisms of the ''Star Wars'' films, such as how [[Darth Sidious]] ascends to power without the [[Jedi]] knowing: "How did we get to a point where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it? [What] went wrong?" She considered herself lucky to be able to ask those questions in an actual ''Star Wars'' project.<ref name="VanityFairMay2022" /><ref name="HeadlandApr2023IGN" /> A key theme in the franchise for Headland was "underdog versus institutional threat", and in this part of the timeline it is the Jedi who are the main institution.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024Collider" /> In contrast to the Jedi in the films, who are monk-like figures in times of war, Headland said the High Republic Jedi live in a time of peace and enlightenment akin to the [[Renaissance]], as seen in their white and gold robes that look like they never get dirty.<ref name="VanityFairMay2022" /> The series questions the Jedi practice of training children,<ref name="HeadlandApr2023IGN" /> and also explores differing views on [[the Force]] and the amount of power and control that the Jedi have.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024Collider" /> Headland took inspiration from the film ''[[Rashomon]]'' (1950) to depict events from multiple perspectives, showing how the series' protagonist, former [[Padawan (Star Wars)|Padawan]] learner Mae, sees things differently to the Jedi Order.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024THR" />

''The Acolyte'' is a [[Mystery fiction|mystery thriller]] with a serialized story that builds throughout the first season, inspired by the approach of fellow ''Star Wars'' series ''[[Andor (TV series)|Andor]]''.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024Collider" /> Because there are no overarching conflicts or wars in the series—Headland said it was "interesting to make a ''Star Wars'' with no war in it"—the fight sequences are more intimate,<ref name="EWPeace" /> focusing on duels that further develop the characters.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024SW" /> Noting that ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] was originally influenced by [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s samurai films, Headland decided to take more influence from [[martial arts]] films which she felt were "a little bit more personal and less global and galactic". These included [[wuxia]] films by [[King Hu]] and [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] such as ''[[Come Drink with Me]]'' (1966) and ''[[A Touch of Zen]]'' (1971).<ref name="VanityFairMay2022Acolyte" /> Similar to the ''Star Wars'' series ''[[The Mandalorian]]'',<ref name="HeadlandMar2024Collider" /> ''The Acolyte'' includes [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] for fans of the original trilogy, [[prequel trilogy]], and the animated series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', as well as references to the EU and [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]]. EU references include members of the Theelin and Zygerrian species as well as some narrative elements.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024THR" /> The series introduces a coven of Force witches, separate from the [[Nightsister]] witches seen in previous ''Star Wars'' projects, inspired by mentions of Force cults in the High Republic books and the EU.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024Collider" />

=== Casting ===
Casting was underway by the end of June 2021, when Lucasfilm were looking to hire a young woman of color for the lead role.<ref name="FilmingLocation" /> [[Amandla Stenberg]] was in talks for that part in December,<ref name="Stenberg" /> and was confirmed to be cast in July 2022.<ref name="Stenberg2" /> [[Jodie Turner-Smith]] and ''Russian Doll'' co-star [[Charlie Barnett (actor)|Charlie Barnett]] entered final negotiations to join the series in September 2022,<ref name="SmithTalks" /><ref name="Barnett" /> when [[Lee Jung-jae]] and [[Manny Jacinto]] were cast. Lee was cast as the male lead,<ref name="Lee" /><ref name="Jacinto" /> after Headland was impressed with his performance in the television series ''[[Squid Game]]''.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024IGN" /> At the start of November, [[Dafne Keen]] was revealed to have a role in the series.<ref name="Keen" /> Soon after, Lucasfilm confirmed the casting of Stenberg, Lee, Jacinto, Turner-Smith, Barnett, and Keen, and announced the casting of [[Dean-Charles Chapman]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]], and Headland's wife [[Rebecca Henderson (actress)|Rebecca Henderson]].<ref name="Nov2022Cast" /><ref name="Rwoh2" /> Headland had Stenberg, Barnett, and Keen in mind when creating their characters;<ref name="StenbergC" /><ref name="HeadlandMar2024IGN" /> she wanted to see Keen with a [[lightsaber]] after her performance as the character [[X-23]] in ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'' (2017).<ref name="HeadlandMar2024IGN" /> [[Margarita Levieva]] was cast in a guest role by the start of December.<ref name="Levieva" />

At [[Star Wars Celebration#Celebration Europe 2023|''Star Wars'' Celebration London]] in April 2023, [[Joonas Suotamo]] was revealed to be part of the series' cast as [[Wookiee]] Jedi Kelnacca. Suotamo previously portrayed the Wookiee [[Chewbacca]] in the [[sequel trilogy]] films and ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' (2018).<ref name="CelebrationLondonEW" /> Also at the convention, Lee, Keen, Barnett, Henderson, and Moss were revealed to be playing Jedi,<ref name="CelebrationLondonGizmodo" /> with Henderson cast as the character Vernestra Rwoh who was introduced in the High Republic publishing initiative.<ref name="Rwoh" /> In March 2024, Headland said Rwoh was the only character from the High Republic books that would appear in the first season, but there were other High Republic characters that she hoped to include in a potential second season. She felt Rwoh was important for showing the state of the Jedi Order in the series, contrasting her role as a leader in the order with the young prodigy she is depicted as in the books.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024Collider" /> Also that month, character details for most of the series' main cast were revealed, with Stenberg as former Padawan Mae, Lee as Jedi Master Sol, Jacinto as former smuggler Qimir, Keen as Padawan Jecki Lon, Barnett as Jedi Knight Yord Fandar, Turner-Smith as coven-leader Mother Aniseya, and Moss as Jedi Master Indara.<ref name="Mar2024DetailsCB" /> Headland said it was a "no-brainer" to cast Moss as Indara, who was inspired by Moss's portrayal of [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] in [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' film series]].<ref name="IndaraTrinity" /> In April, [[David Harewood]] was reported to have a small role in the series.<ref name="Harewood" />

=== Design ===
Headland noted that the original trilogy has a lived-in quality while the prequel trilogy is sleeker and more advanced. With ''The Acolyte'', she carried on this concept of "the further you go back, the more exciting and new and sleek and interesting things look".<ref name="VanityFairMay2022Acolyte" /> It was important for her to replicate the white and gold Jedi robes from the High Republic books to symbolize the state of the Order, compared to the brown robes later worn in the films.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024Collider" />

=== Filming ===
[[Principal photography]] began by October 30, 2022, at Shinfield Studios in [[Berkshire]],<ref name="Filming" /><ref name="FilmingWrap" /> under the [[working title]] ''Paradox''.<ref name="WorkingTitle" /> Headland, Kogonada, Lopez, and Culpepper directed two episodes each.<ref name="Mar2024DetailsSW" /> [[James Friend]] and Chris Teague served as cinematographers.<ref name="Friend" /><ref name="Teague" />{{Better source needed|date=March 2024}} The series was initially reported to be using visual effects company [[Industrial Light & Magic]]'s [[StageCraft]] technology to shoot in front of digital backgrounds on a [[video wall]], as was done for ''The Mandalorian'' and its spin-off series,<ref name="FilmingLocation" /> but Headland later said the series was primarily filmed on practical sets and did not use the technology,<ref name="HeadlandMar2024THR" /> for creative and logistical reasons.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024IGN" />

Location filming had begun in Wales by January 2023,<ref name="WalesLocations" /> including at [[Brecon Beacons National Park]].<ref name="FilmingWrap" /> From mid to late March, filming took place on [[Madeira Island]], Portugal,<ref name="PortugalFilming" /><ref name="PortugalFilming2" /><ref name="PortugalFilming3" /> including at Fanal Forest and the parishes of [[Caniçal]] and [[Ribeira da Janela]].<ref name="PortugalFilming4" /> In early April, there were said to be only a few weeks of production remaining.<ref name="CelebrationLondonGizmodo" /> Filming officially [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on June 6.<ref name="FilmingWrap" /> Headland said filming went smoothly despite the length of production and the amount of action sequences and [[wire-work]]. She said the cast did most of their own action scenes, including actors who had worked in action before such as Lee, Keen, and Moss. Stenberg, who was new to action, "threw herself into training and did incredible work in a short amount of time".<ref name="HeadlandMar2024THR" />

=== Post-production ===
Miikka Leskinen was one of the series' editors.<ref name="Leskinen" />{{Third-party source needed|date=March 2024}} Headland said [[Automated dialogue replacement|ADR]] work could not be completed during the [[2023 SAG-AFTRA strike]] which delayed the end of post-production, but the series was mostly done by March 2024.<ref name="HeadlandMar2024THR" />

== Music ==
[[Michael Abels]] was hired to compose the score for the series by February 2024.<ref name="Abels" />

== Marketing ==
Headland and members of the cast presented the first footage from the series at ''Star Wars'' Celebration London in April 2023.<ref name="CelebrationLondonEW" /> The first trailer was publicly released in March 2024, and teases that Jedi are being killed. Charles Pulliam-Moore of ''[[The Verge]]'' speculated that Stenberg's character could be the murderer and highlighted the darker aspects of the trailer, including the suggestion that many characters could die in the series.<ref name="VergeTrailer" /> ''[[IGN]]''{{'s}} Ryan Dinsdale noted the elements in the trailer that are associated with the High Republic, including the white robes and yellow lightsabers of some Jedi characters, and compared some scenes to the aesthetics of the original and prequel trilogies.<ref name="IGNTrailer" /> Writing for ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', Ben Travis discussed how the series had been kept a mystery for so long but was finally starting to publicly reveal details with this trailer. He opined that while ''Andor'' focuses on human drama, the trailer indicates that ''The Acolyte'' will be going "all-out on colourful species, lightsabers, and Force-users", and he praised the small amount of action that the trailer shows.<ref name="EmpireTrailer" /> Lucasfilm announced that the trailer was watched 51.3 million times in its first 24 hours, setting a record for the company's streaming series by surpassing the trailers for ''The Mandalorian'', ''[[The Book of Boba Fett]]'', ''Andor'', ''[[Obi-Wan Kenobi (TV series)|Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'', and ''[[Ahsoka (TV series)|Ahsoka]]''.<ref name="LucasfilmTrailerViews" /> An exclusive preview of the series will be included at the end of 25th anniversary theatrical screenings of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), starting on May 3 in time for ''Star Wars'' Day on May 4.<ref name="TPMExclusiveLook" />

== Release ==
''The Acolyte'' is scheduled to premiere on Disney+ on June 4, 2024, with its first two episodes. The other six episodes will be released weekly.<ref name="Mar2024DetailsSW" />

== Lawsuit ==
In March 2023, Karyn McCarthy sued Lucasfilm over breach of contract, stating that she was offered a producer role on both ''The Acolyte'' and the [[Apple TV+]] series ''[[Sugar (2024 TV series)|Sugar]]'' and chose ''The Acolyte''. After several weeks of work in April 2022 based on an initial agreement with Lucasfilm, McCarthy alleged that the studio chose to end her deal and not pay her for her work so far. By that time, the ''Sugar'' role was unavailable.<ref name="McCarthySue" />
